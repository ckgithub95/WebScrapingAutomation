## Project Overview

This project automates the following tasks:
1. Logging into a website using user credentials.
2. Scraping data from specific web pages.
3. Storing the extracted data into Excel files (`.xlsx`) for further analysis.

## Features

- **Login Automation:** Automates the login process using credentials.
- **Data Scraping:** Scrapes specific data from web pages using BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Storage:** Extracted data is saved in structured format (Excel).

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-repo-name

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the project scripts:
   python login.py
   python web_scrape.py

---

## Usage
1. Login Script
The login.py script automates logging into a website using saved credentials. Ensure that the credentials are provided in the appropriate section within the code.

2. Web Scraping Script
The web_scrape.py script scrapes the target webpage(s) for specified data and exports it to scraped_data.xlsx. Update the script with the correct URLs for your specific use case.

## bash
python web_scrape.py

Data will be saved in the scraped_data.xlsx file.

## Running Your Tests

1. Install Required Packages: Make sure you have any dependencies installed. You can run your tests with:
   python -m unittest discover -s tests

2. Structure of Your Project:
   WebScrapingAutomation/
   ├── login.py
   ├── web_scrape.py
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── test_login.py
   │   └── test_web_scrape.py

Notes:
   Make sure to replace the placeholder function names and expected values with those relevant to your actual implementation.
   You may need to mock network calls for the scraping tests if you're testing with live data, to avoid rate limiting or changes in the webpage structure.
